## 10/4/2025 - Ideation and concept  

The key point of this journal entry: **This design has the same concept (with added features) as the last design, but is going to be *totally restructured and redesigned* in this version.**

After making my previous model, I realized that there were far more optimizations and things I could make better with the concept itself. With the last model, it was entirely controlled by transistor logic, which reduced that chance of errors, but also limited functionality and safety features. Having a ton of transistors and an extra PCB for the control board also cost a lot more then just a RPi Pico, and having physical switches increased the chance of error. 

In this model, I'm using RPi Pico paired with MOSFETs in order to control the entire thing with zero user input, keeping the LEDs (for user feedback, both for error notification and for cell status), while retaining all of the previous features. I'm also sigificantly reducing the number of ports, making it far smaller, as I can now use smart cell detection to use mosfets to accommodate for the cells. By using MOSFET control and not switch control, I can also charge with far more current then previously.
